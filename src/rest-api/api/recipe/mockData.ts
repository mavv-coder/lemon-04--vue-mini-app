      "Quiche is a French dish typically comprised of a pastry shell (not unlike a pie crust) filled with a savory egg custard and any number of ingredients like vegetables, meat and cheese. After baking, the custard's texture should be delicate, airy and slightly creamy. The egg flavor should not be too forward so it can act as the perfect vessel for the other delicious ingredients you add.",

      "Strawberry cake is sweet and tart and unmatched to other cakes. The cream cheese frosting is what really makes this cake. Making strawberry compote is easier than you'd think. All you're doing is cooking down the fresh berries with sugar and lemon juice. We used it in the batter and frosting to make sure that the cake has the best strawberry flavor possible. The compote will make a little more than you need, but you can use leftover just as you would jam! It will keep refrigerated for 1 week. ",
